# Community Applied ML Prototype (AMP) Catalog

AMPs provide **end-to-end ML use cases that can be deployed with one click** directly from Cloudera Machine Learning (CML). They enable data scientists to go from an idea to a fully working ML use case in a fraction of the time it would otherwise take, with an end-to-end framework for building, deploying and monitoring business-ready ML applications. Visit the [AMP landing page](https://cloudera.github.io/Applied-ML-Prototypes/#/) to learn more!

This repository contains the default Community AMP Catalog - a collection of AMPs built by community.
