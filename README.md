# Community Applied ML Prototype (AMP) Catalog

Community Applied ML Prototypes (Community AMPs) provide reference example machine learning projects in Cloudera Machine Learning(CML). More than simplified quickstarts or tutorials, these are fully-developed expert solutions created by peers outside of Cloudera. These enable data scientists to go from an idea to a fully working ML use case in a fraction of the time and provides an end-to-end framework for building, deploying, and monitoring business-ready ML applications instantly. As new AMPs are developed by the community and approved by the review committee, they will become available to you for your study and use. 

This repository contains the default Community AMP Catalog - a collection of AMPs built by community.
